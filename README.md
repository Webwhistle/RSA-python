### Safe asymmetric encryption

RSA cryptosystem is a safe method of encryption and decryption with distinct public and private keys. This particular project has been **partly** inspired by the recommendations from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). However, the implementation is a text-book version of RSA and doesn't include a sophisticated padding scheme.

### Usage
To use the modules from this package, download or clone this repo and from the root folder run python3 -m 'module.module' in terminal. Example: Run 'python3 -m rsa_python.terminal_gui' to access a simple terminal GUI.
